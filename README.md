## What is it?
As a developer I usually have so many commands to use every day, it is essential for me to manage them clearly and copy them quickly.

So what I need is a simple UI to click and a .yaml file to define.
### UI
<img src="./img/ui.png" width = "70%" />

### Yaml
<img src="./img/yaml.png" width = "70%" />
